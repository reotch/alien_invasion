# Invasion!

(It's totally not Space Invaders or anything)

The Invasion! game is created from a tutorial. The player controls a ship that moves across the bottom of the screen. The arrow keys direct the ship. The spacebar will shoot. At the beginning of the game a fleet of aliens appears throughout the sky. The goal is to shoot all the aliens. When the goal is achieved a new alien fleet arrives, faster than the previous one. If an alien lands, the ship is destroyed. If three ships are destroyed, the Earth is lost.

## TODO

### Customizations

- Add a "flip" mode, where the ships switch sides
- power-ups (e.g., shields when completing a level without losing a ship)
